# üí´ About Me:
Hi there! I‚Äôm Minh (also goes by Amanda), a data enthusiast with a passion for education and edtech. My journey began with a double major in Data Analytics and Educational Studies at Dickinson College, which sparked my interest in how data can shape educational policies. I‚Äôve had the privilege of working in collegiate athletics and in K-5 education non-profit, where I used data to make a difference in education spaces and support underserved communities.<br><br>Most recently, I‚Äôm diving into exciting research projects, developing tools like a predictive decision tree model and a user-facing dashboard to guide educational pathways. I‚Äôm also exploring text analysis to secure data integrity in higher ed. In short, I see data as a powerful tool for improving educational solutions and promoting equity in EdTech.<br><br>Outside of data, I dabble in developing web apps. Some of my works include e-cards and simple math games for kids. When I‚Äôm not crunching numbers or coding, you can find me in the kitchen cooking and baking, or unwinding with some painting!
