# üí´ About Me:
Hi there! I'm Minh (Amanda)‚Äîa curious soul who stumbled into the world of data and never found my way out. What began as tinkering with numbers at Dickinson College blossomed into a love for learning sciences and technology.

These days, you'll find me at Penn GSE's Wonder Lab, where I'm exploring computer-supported collaborative learning and AI-powered learning technologies. I collaborate with partners to design teaching curricula that integrate data science to address real-world challenges or dabble in building tools that leverage technology to make collaborative learning more meaningful. Before all this, my journey has taken me through collegiate athletics, where I built Bayesian models to evaluate player efficiency, and K-4 education, where I crafted interactive math games and curricula that made numbers feel like magic for young learners and their families.

When I'm not lost in code or conducting thematic analysis, I'm creating web applications that bring a smile to someone's day. And if the digital world gets too pixelated, you might catch me experimenting with recipes in the kitchen or letting colors dance across a canvas.

Always up for a chat about AIEd, collaborative learning, or how we can blend tech and human connection to create meaningful learning experiences. Because in my story, technology isn't just a tool‚Äîit's the plot twist that makes learning an adventure worth sharing!
